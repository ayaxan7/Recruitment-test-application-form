# Ace Society Recruitment Webpage

This repository contains a sample code for a webpage designed to facilitate student recruitment for the Ace Society clubs.

***Note:*** *This project is solely for educational purposes and serves as a demonstration. It was created by me as a part of my learning process in web development.*

## Contents 

The repository consists of the following files:

- **index.html** - The main HTML page featuring the application/registration form  
- **style.css** - Stylesheet providing styling for the index.html page
- **thnq.html** - A simple HTML thank you page displayed after form submission
- **style1.css** - Additional stylesheet utilized for the thnq.html page

## Functionality

The primary **index.html** page hosts a form where students can input details such as name, email, etc. Upon submission, **thnq.html** confirms the successful submission.

**style.css** governs the CSS styling for the visual layout and design.

## Usage

This code serves as a foundation for constructing a sample registration/application form page. It can be employed for learning and experimenting with HTML forms, custom styling, and form UX flows.

Given that this is merely a demonstration, the data is not linked to a database or backend.

## Disclaimer

This sample form is exclusively for educational and demonstration purposes. It was created by me as my first project for learning purposes and is not associated with any real organization.
