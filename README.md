Got it, thanks for clarifying. Here is an updated README with that note:

# Ace Society Recruitment Webpage

This repo contains a sample code for a webpage to allow students to apply for recruitment in the Ace Society clubs.

***Note:*** *This is not a real application form and is for demo purposes only, created by [your_name] for learning web development.*

## Contents 

The repo contains the following files:

- **index.html** - The main HTML page with the application/registration form  
- **style.css** - Stylesheet providing styling for index.html page
- **style1.css** - Additional stylesheet, likely used for a separate page
- **thnq.html** - A simple HTML thank you page shown after form submission

## Functionality

The main **index.html** page contains a form allowing students to input details like name, email, etc. Once submitted, **thnq.html** confirms the submission.

**style.css** provides the CSS styling for the visual layout and design.

## Usage

This code allows for building a sample registration/application form page. It can be used for learning and experimenting with HTML forms, custom styling, and form UX flows.

As this is just a demo, the data is not connected to a database or backend. 

## Disclaimer

This sample form is for educational and demo purposes only, created by [your_name], and not affiliated with any real organization.

Let me know if you need any other clarification in the README!
